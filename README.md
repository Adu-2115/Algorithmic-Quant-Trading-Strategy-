# Algorithmic-Quant-Trading-Strategy-
Quant trading strategy using Python, technical indicators, and portfolio optimization.

This project implements a systematic quant trading strategy that utilizes historical price data, technical indicators, and portfolio optimization techniques to generate dynamic investment allocations. Built with Python, it leverages libraries like PyPortfolioOpt, pandas, NumPy, and yfinance to:

      Calculate asset returns and risks
      
      Construct mean-variance optimized portfolios
      
      Compare strategy performance vs. benchmarks (e.g., SPY)
      
      Apply clustering and backtesting to refine allocations

Includes data preprocessing, strategy logic, performance evaluation, and visualizations.
