# Algorithmic-Quant-Trading-Strategy-
Quant trading strategy using Python, technical indicators, and portfolio optimization.

This project implements a systematic quant trading strategy that utilizes historical price data, technical indicators, and portfolio optimization techniques to generate dynamic investment allocations. Built with Python, it leverages libraries like PyPortfolioOpt, pandas, NumPy, and yfinance to:

 Calculate asset returns and risks
 Construct mean-variance optimized portfolios
 Compare strategy performance vs. benchmarks (e.g., SPY)
 Apply clustering and backtesting to refine allocations

Includes data preprocessing, strategy logic, performance evaluation, and visualizations.

The plot compares cumulative returns of the custom "Unsup Trading Strategy" (in red) vs SPY Buy & Hold (in blue) from 2016 to 2025.
The strategy not only outperforms in overall return (~190% vs ~145%), but also shows lower drawdowns during turbulent periods like 2020 and 2021, indicating better downside protection and risk management.
